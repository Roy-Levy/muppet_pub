## Overview

The `muppet` package executes Measurement and Uncertainty Preserving ParamETric (MUPPET) modeling. MUPPET is a modular approach to model fitting, using Bayesian approaches to modeling and estimation. Models and analyses are conceived of in terms of fragments. Each may be fit to data or analyzed, possibly conditional on antecedent fragments. In that case, the results from the antecedent fragments are carried forward to those that depend on them. 

## Installation

You can install the current public version of muppet from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")  # if you don't have remotes installed
remotes::install_github("Roy-Levy/muppet_pub")
```

## Examples

The [Examples and Tips](https://roy-levy.github.io/muppet_pub/articles/index.html) page has some examples and explanations of some of the basic functionality.
